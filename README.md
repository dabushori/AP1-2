### In this assignment we created:
* Mat.cpp + Mat.h - a matrix class in cpp.
* exceptions.cpp + exceptions.h - throwing exceptions.
* * *
## Mat (Matrix) class is doing the following functions:
* Constructor
* Copy constructor
* Copy assignment operator
* Move Constructor
* Move assignment operator
* Destructor
* Get height and width
* Set value
* Add another matrix
* Multiply the matrix with another matrix
* Multiply the matrix by scalar
* Operator (rowIndex, colIndex) - get the value in the matrix
* * *
## ErrorCodesException class:
* Exception that is dealing with the ErrorCode struct.
* * *
## Tests
* Tested the Matrix part with tests that we made.
* Tested the code with tests that we got from our fellow students.
* Tested the BMP with the "woman" that you gave us.
* Tested the BMP with a couple more photos that we created.
